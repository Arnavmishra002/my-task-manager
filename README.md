# Collaborative Task Manager - Full Stack Assessment

This repository contains a production-ready, full-stack Task Management Application built with the PERN/MERN stack principle (using SQLite/Prisma for this environment). It fully meets the assessment requirements for Authentication, CRUD, and Real-time collaboration.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Authentication**: Secure Registration/Login using JWT and bcrypt hashing (12 rounds).
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with status and priority tracking.
- **Dashboard Views**: Filter tasks by "Assigned to Me", "Created by Me", and "Overdue".
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Instant updates across clients when a task is modified (via Socket.io).

### Engineering Highlights
- **Architecture**: Service/Controller pattern with DTO Validation (Zod).
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for robust server-state caching.
- **Form Handling**: Client-side validation mirroring backend DTOs.
- **Networking**: Robust Proxy configuration (`0.0.0.0` Backend <-> `127.0.0.1` Frontend) ensuring IPv4 consistency.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init # Initializes SQLite DB
npm run dev
```
*Server runs on `http://localhost:4000` (Socket.io enabled).*

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
*Client runs on `http://localhost:5173`.*

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### 1. Database Choice: SQLite (via Prisma)
- **Decision**: While PostgreSQL is standard for prod, SQLite was chosen for this assessment to ensure a **zero-config**, file-based database that works instantly in any local environment without requiring a separate server process.
- **Switching to Postgres**: Thanks to **Prisma**, switching is as simple as changing the `provider` in `schema.prisma`.

### 2. Real-Time Logic (Socket.io)
- **Integration**: The `io` instance is attached to the Express `app`.
- **Flow**:
  1.  Controller handles HTTP Request (e.g., `updateTask`).
  2.  Service updates DB.
  3.  Controller accesses `req.app.get('io')` and emits `taskUpdated`.
  4.  Frontend `useSocket` hook receives event -> calls `queryClient.invalidateQueries`.
  5.  **Benefit**: The frontend automatically re-fetches the freshest data, ensuring 100% consistency without manual state patching.

### 3. Authentication Strategy
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication.
- **Safety**: Frontend `AuthContext` includes a race-condition guard to prevent redirect loops.
- **Persistence**: Token stored in `localStorage` for session persistence across reloads.

### 4. Trade-offs
- **Assignment**: Currently, assignment is by User ID. In a refined UI, we would implement a User Search/Dropdown (Stubbed in `walkthrough.md`).
- **Authorization**: All authenticated users can view tasks. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) was out of scope but can be added via middleware.

## 🏗️ Docker Support

Run the entire stack with a single command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 📜 Audit Logging

Changes to tasks are automatically logged to the `AuditLog` table in the database, tracking `who`, `what`, and `when`.

## ⚡ Optimistic UI

The Task List uses React Query's `onMutate` to instantly update the UI when you modify a task, reverting only if the server request fails.

Run backend unit tests:
```bash
cd server
npm test
```
